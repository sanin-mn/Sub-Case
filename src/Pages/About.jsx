      <p className='text-secondary fs-5 p-5 container'>Any Malayalee who loves movies for whom language is a barrier to enjoy world movies can download and use Subcase translations for free. Earlier, we provided translations only for foreign classic films, but due to increasing popularity and audience demands, we are now providing translations for non-Indian languages as well. Now it is reaching the translations of even Tamil movies. It is a matter of great joy for Subcase that it has been able to change the movie tastes of a group of Malayalee viewers . Subcase is a not-for-profit organization that grew out of the love of good movies. Our strength is  people who enjoy movies with Subcase on and off the site. Using Subcase translations, various film societies are organizing screenings of the best world films all over Kerala and promoting Subcase translations. This helps the film to reach people from all walks of life regardless of language barriers. We are honored to be a part of it.</p>
